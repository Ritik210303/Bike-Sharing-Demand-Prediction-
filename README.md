# 🚲 Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction  

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **predicting the demand for bike rentals** using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data, including **weather conditions, time of day, and seasonal patterns**, the model helps bike-sharing companies **optimize fleet distribution, reduce shortages, and improve customer satisfaction**.

## 🔍 Objectives  
- Forecast daily and hourly **bike rental demand** based on historical data.  
- Identify key factors affecting **bike usage trends** (weather, season, working hours).  
- Implement a **multiple linear regression model** to make accurate predictions.  
- Optimize resource allocation to prevent **bike shortages or excess availability**.  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Multiple Linear Regression  
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Dataset  
- The dataset contains records of bike rentals, including:  
  - **Date, time, and seasonality factors**  
  - **Temperature, humidity, and wind speed**  
  - **Number of bikes rented per hour/day**  

## 📊 Key Analysis Steps  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.  
2. **EDA & Feature Engineering:** Identifying demand patterns using visualizations.  
3. **Model Implementation:** Training a **multiple linear regression model** for predictions.  
4. **Model Evaluation:** Measuring **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** and adjusting hyperparameters.  

## 📌 Key Findings  
- **Weather conditions significantly impact bike demand** – Rides decrease in extreme temperatures or high humidity.  
- **Peak demand occurs during rush hours and weekdays**, aligning with work commutes.  
- **Seasonal trends show higher demand in summer and lower usage in winter**.
